Cocaine, like amphetamines, acts by multiple mechanisms on brain catecholaminergic neurons; the mechanism of its reinforcing effects is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine uptake.","COCAINE","I5Y540LHVR",7.5,"Ki","INHIBITOR","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL370805","CHEMBL",

Following administration of DaTscan to humans, radioactive decay of the iodine 123 emits gamma radiation which can be detected externally using gamma detectors, allowing visualization of the brain striata through SPECT imaging. Autoradiography of post-mortem human brain slices exposed to radiolabeled ioflupane shows concentration of the radiolabel in striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen). The specificity of the binding of ioflupane I 125 to dopamine transporter was demonstrated by competition studies with the DaT inhibitor GBR 12909 (a dopamine reuptake inhibitor), the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, and the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine in post-mortem human brain slices exposed to radiolabeled ioflupane.  Citalopram reduced binding in the neocortex and thalamus with only minor effects in the striatum. This indicated that the binding in the cortex and thalamus is mainly to the serotonin reuptake sites.  Desipramine showed no effect on the level of striatal binding of ioflupane I 125, but reduced extrastriatal binding by 60 to 85%.  The binding of ioflupane I 125 to the striatum was abolished in the presence of high concentrations of GBR 12909, indicating selectivity of ioflupane binding for the pre-synaptic DaT.",,,9.21,"Ki","BINDING AGENT","https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/022454Orig1s000Lbl.pdf","DRUG LABEL",

It binds to aggregated tau protein. In the brains of patients with AD, tau aggregates combine to form NFTs, one of two components required for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. In vitro, flortaucipir F 18 binds to paired helical filament (PHF) tau purified from brain homogenates of donors with AD. The dissociation constant (Kd) of flortaucipir F 18 binding to PHFs is 0.57 nM. In vivo, flortaucipir F 18 is differentially retained in neocortical areas that contain aggregated tau. In vitro, tritiated flortaucipir has been reported to bind with low nanomolar affinity to monoamine oxidase-A and monoamine oxidase-B, which could contribute to off target binding","FLORTAUCIPIR F-18","T1JP1KYU9O",9.24,"Kd","BINDING AGENT","https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/212123s000lbl.pdf","DRUG LABEL",
